a very ugly half working desktop authenticator. i made this because why not. might be discontinuing this when i get bitwarden premium.

how to use:

1. click the green **Code** button and download the repository as a ZIP file.
2. extract the ZIP file.
3. open a terminal in the extracted folder and run this command (make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH):  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. open `main.py` to run the program.
5. enjoy
